        "In this course, we will later examine the equations governing relativistic particle dynamics in detail. For now, you will have to take them as a given. Recall that there exist two categories of elementary particles: fermions, with half-integer spin, and bosons, with integer spin. In particle physics, we take the perspective that particles are really excitations of fields which exist throughout all of space-time. Let's start with the simplest quantum field - a scalar field. At every point in space-time $x^\\mu$, this field takes on a real value, $\\phi(x^\\mu)$. Since this is a scalar field, and spin is a vector quantity, this field must represent a spin 0 particle, a so-called \"scalar boson.\" The Lagrangian of this field is: $$\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial t}\\right)^2 - \\frac{1}{2}(\\vec{\\nabla}\\phi)^2 -\\frac{1}{2} m^2\\phi^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\eta^{\\mu\\nu}\\partial_\\mu\\phi\\partial_\\nu\\phi -\\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 $$.\n",

        "Let us now explore a real particle interaction. We will start with what we call an \"effective field theory.\" At sufficiently low energies, this theory is sufficient to describe the interaction, however it breaks down at higher energies. The (arguably) most well-known example of an effective field theory is Fermi's Theory of Beta decay. In this theory, a neutron decays into a proton and an electron as well as a light, neutral electron *anti-neutrino.* See the corresponding Feynman diagram [here](https://https://www.quantumdiaries.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/fourFermi_BetaDecay.png).\n",

We use $u$ and $\\overline{u}$ to represent the spinor fields of the fermions at play. *Spinor fields of incoming anti-particles and outgoing particles get bars over the $u$'s. Spinor fields of incoming particles and outgoing anti-particles do not get bars.* The subscripts $p, n, e, \\overline{\\nu}$ refer to the proton, neutron, electron, and anti-neutrino respectively. The $\\gamma$'s again refer to a set of 4 $\\times$ 4 matrices, and the $\\mu$ still represents the 4 space-time indices that we sum over. **Using what you know about fermion fields, what must the dimension of the constant of proportionality be in the Fermi theory?** This constant of proportionality is called the Fermi constant, and it is quite important in Weak interaction physics."
